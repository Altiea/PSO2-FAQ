As with every online game, PSO2 has its own bundle of new words to learn and digest. So to make it easier, we'll divide up the terminology by category.


#### Player Stats
As per all RPGs, Phantasy Star Online 2 uses a slough of stat types that increase specific attributes to your player character. Some increase your weapon damage, others increase your damage variance, and your defense. Here is a breakdown of each stat-type:

![](character%20stats.jpg)

* **HP** - Your health points.
* **PP** - **Photon Points**, PP is consumed every time a **Photon Art** (PA) or **Technique** is used, and if there is not enough PP, the PA or Technique cannot be used. You can recover spent PP by using normal attacks.
* **S-ATK** - **Striking Attack**, deals striking type damage. Weapons that scale off S-ATK deal striking based damage.
* **R-ATK** - **Ranged Attack**, deals ranged type damage. Weapons that scale off R-ATK deal ranged based damage.
* **T-ATK** - **Technique Attack**, deals technique type damage. Weapons that scale off T-ATK deal technique based damage.
* **DEX** - **Dexterity/Skill**, controls your damage variance. All weapons and enemies have a hidden dex stat that determines the damage variance. A higher enemy dex and a lower weapon and player dex score will deal low damage, whereas a weapon and player dex score that is higher than an enemy will increase your damage. Unless otherwise stated in certain class build guides, you don't have to worry about increasing this particular stat as the base number is usually enough.
* **S-DEF** - **Striking Defense**, determines how much damage is reduced from enemy striking attacks.
* **R-DEF** - **Ranged Defense**, determines how much damage is reduced from enemy ranged attacks.
* **T-DEF** - **Technique Defense**, determines how much damage is reduced from enemy technique attacks.
* **Attr. Resists** - **Attribute Resists**, these determine how much elemental attribute damage is reduced from enemy attacks. Each enemy attack, on top of being a striking, ranged, or technique based attack, also may use certain elemental type of attacks that are affected by your Elemental Attribute Resists.

#### Weapons
Weapons are divided into three separate types, **<span style="color:red;">Striking</span>**, **<span style="color:blue;">Ranged</span>** and **<span style="color:gold;">Technique</span>**.

Striking-type weapons include **Swords, Wired Lances, Partizans, Knuckles, Twin Daggers, Double Sabers, Katanas, Dual Blades, and Gunslashes**. Ranged-type weapons include **Assault Rifles, Launchers, Compound Bows, Gunslashes & Twin Machineguns**. Technique-type weapons include **Rods, Wands, Talises, Jet Boots, andTakts**.

The gunslash is a weapon that is a fusion of a gun and a saber, that allow you to swap between its gun and blade modes. Each of the weapons will perform differently depending on the class they are used with.

Weapons in PSO2 also can be improved upon to increase their stats and allow players to augment their own stats by adding **special abilities** or **affixes** on to the weapon itself. **Strengthening** or 
**grinding** weapons to increase their stats can also unlock their **potential ability** and if the weapon supports it, their **Special Ability Factor (SAF)**.

#### Units (Armor)
In very much the same in other RPGs, protecting yourself using armor is very important. Phantasy Star Online 2's quests can give the average player a hard time or an easier time with the right armor and weapon on their side. PSO2's armor unit system also allows players to augment their stats in a similar fashion to weapons.

There are 4 types of units, **Rear, Arm, Leg, and Sub.** 
![](units.png)
1. This slot is reserved for rear units. Rear units are defined by having **Rear** in their name.
2. This slot is reserved for arm units. Arm units are defined by having **Arm** in their name.
3. This slot is reserved for leg units. Leg units are defined by having **Leg** in their name.

Sub units are definied by having **Sub** in their name. They may be placed into any armor slot.
