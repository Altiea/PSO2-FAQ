Let's talk about classes, or as other games may call them, jobs. There are **9 Normal classes** plus **3 additional Successor classes** in PSO2. Each class fullfills a specific role in terms of what they do. However, unlike other standard RPGs, PSO2 does not follow what some may call, the "holy trinity", which are heals, tank, DPS. The general gameplay in which PSO2 follows, is fast paced action. Thus it is highly recommended that players should obtain skills and adjust their gameplay for the nature of the game itself.

Let's start by examining each class at a glance. We won't go over into detail on how to play each class, but will give a brief summary of what they do and how they play.
