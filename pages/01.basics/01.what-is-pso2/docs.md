## What is PSO2?
**Phantasy Star Online 2 (PSO2)** is a free-to-play Action Online RPG created by SEGA, released originally in Japan on July 2012, with servers released in **South East Asia (SEA)** and **Taiwan (TW)**, with an upcoming server in **North America (NA)** being released sometime in Spring 2020. The SEA servers were terminated in 2017, along with the Taiwan servers.

PSO2 has been released on the **Playstation 4**, **Nintendo Switch** (Cloud streaming version only), **Playstation Vita**, **PC**, and **Xbox One** (NA exclusive). PSO2 has also spawned several side games, two released on mobile **(PSO2es & Idola: Phantasy Star Saga)** and another game that is separate to the main story of PSO2 **(Phantasy Star Nova)**, also released on the Vita.

## Getting the game

#### PC
You will need to setup an account with SEGA on their japanese website. A detailed guide can be found [here](http://www.bumped.org/psublog/phantasy-star-online-2-registration-guide/).

You will also need to download the game, which at the time of writing, is **70 GB**. More information on installing and setting the game up using the English Patch using the PSO2 Tweaker can be found [here](http://www.bumped.org/psublog/phantasy-star-online-2-registration-guide/).

## Starting & selecting a ship

#### PC
PSO2 divides each server into "Ships". There are 10 ships in total, with each with its own game lobby instance. They are as followed:
* Ship01: Feoh
* Ship02: Ur
* Ship03: Thorn
* Ship04: Ansur
* Ship05: Laguz
* Ship06: Ken
* Ship07: Geofu
* Ship08: Wynn
* Ship09: Hagall
* Ship10: Nauthiz

The majority of the English community is located in Ship02: Ur, and the most populated overall is Ship04: Ansur.

When starting the game for the very first time and logging in using the **Japanese launcher** or the **PSO2 Tweaker**, you'll be asked to enter a Player ID number.
